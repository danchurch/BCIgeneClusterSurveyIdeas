I want to test the idea that the microbiome is responding with secondary metabolites to disease, by metabarcoding 
secondary metabolites. 

What do we need to adapt to this new system?

In some ways, this is simpler. One bad guy (Sphaeropsis), one host species, fairly simple mycobiome. 

How can we use the previous data? 

Were there any individuals who did not progress in disease severity over the times sampled? - watch these trees! 

Dream list: 

genotype hosts (radseq?)

RNAseq in twigs of various stages of infection: quantify host response, and mine for microbiome response. 

Data data data - how much time do we have?


Comparisons:

Within diseased trees, compare disease/non-disease twigs
Among trees in a disease ceneter, compare healthy and non-tree
Among sites, compare common microbes and tree genotypes


previous grants were canopy based, spatially explicit





Is there a genome for the host? sort of:

Is there a sphaeropis genome?

Can we do a "quick" network analysis on the old data? Check for changes in the structure 
of the fungal community

So generally, what are we proposing?

1) Mining host transcriptome for fungal gene expression

2) metabarcoding of microbiomes for secondary metabolomes
